# Seating Chart (A royal arrangement)

### Overview

_Seating Chart_ is a narrative deduction puzzle game. The player must plan a royal wedding banquet and arrange guests around tables according to social rules and personal preferences. Success comes from satisfying all constraints, while failure is met with snarky notes from the royal prince (the groom) and the option to try again.

The game blends **logic puzzle mechanics** with **character-driven storytelling**.

### Core Pillars & Design Goals

* **Narrative Deduction:** Discovering world lore and character relationships as a fun puzzle mechanic.
* **Humor & Tone:** Ludicrous social rules, personal drama and the prince’s commentary keep even failure entertaining.
* **UI as Narrative Space**: Seating chart interface with notes and name cards creates story immersion with minimal graphics.

***

### Gameplay Loop

1. Review the guest cards and notes thrown on the desk.
2. Drag and drop guests into seats on the banquet tables.
3. Validate the arrangement.
4. Read the prince's reaction.
5. Iterate until all rules are satisfied.

### Core Systems

* **Seating Chart:** \
  Round or rectangular tables with relationship logic (next to, opposite, same table, room zone).
* **Guest Cards:** Portrait, name, description, rules.
* **Notes:** Narrative flavor, hints, or distractions delivered as “thrown” scraps.

***

### Minimum Viable Prototype

* 1 banquet table.
* 5–6 guests.
* 2–3 rules per guest.
* Basic validation system.
* Prince commentary for success, near-success, and failure.
